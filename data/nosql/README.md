These are sample manual-coding datasets used to illustrate noSQL databases.
- `dataset_code.csv` is the raw dataset, with links to the original tweets.
- `gold_20180514_majority.csv` is the gold-standard dataset of tweets on which the majority of coders agreed (copied locally under the name `slo_code.csv`, with the tags removed)
They were not used in the SLO system as constructed here.
